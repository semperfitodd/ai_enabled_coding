## Modules Overview

| **Module Title**                           | **Focus Area**                                   | **Primary Takeaway**                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Module 0: Introduction                     | Introduce the course                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Module 1: Modularizing Tasks for AI Coding | Task decomposition; prompt chaining and iteration | Use a modular code structure and break work into small, well-defined units, applying iterative prompts so the AI focuses on one part at a time. This keeps changes predictable and minimizes unintended side-effects. |
| Module 2: Prompt Engineering Techniques    | Crafting clear, structured prompts               | Design prompts thoughtfully – be specific, provide examples, and use techniques like “meta-prompting” and chaining. Clear prompts guide the AI to produce more accurate, context-aware code. |
| Module 3: Leveraging AI’s Strengths        | AI capabilities and limitations                  | Let AI handle repetitive tasks, boilerplate code and test generation, but rely on your expertise for complex logic and design. AI does not replace human judgment. |
| Module 4: Code Review & Validation         | Human review; testing and QA                     | Treat AI-generated code like any other code: always perform human review and automated testing. Validate all suggestions for correctness, readability and security before merging. |
| Module 5: Security Best Practices          | Security scanning; data confidentiality          | Apply “shift-left” security: use independent linters and scanners on AI code in your IDE and keep humans in the loop. Never expose secrets or proprietary data to the model. |
| Module 6: Dependency & IP Management       | Open-source vetting; license and IP protection   | Vet all AI-suggested dependencies with Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools. Confirm licenses and versions. Enforce policies to protect proprietary code and data. |
| Module 7: Testing & Debugging with AI      | AI-assisted testing; automated debug aids        | Use AI to generate unit tests or find bugs and ask it to explain errors. However, manually verify each fix and test. Don’t blindly trust AI fixes. |
| Module 8: Collaboration & Documentation    | Team workflows; commit and docs automation       | Leverage AI to streamline team tasks: draft commit messages, pull-request summaries, or technical docs. Review all AI-generated communications for accuracy. |
| Module 9: Responsible AI Use               | Privacy, ethics, and compliance                  | Only share non-sensitive information with AI tools. Treat every prompt as if it becomes training data. Do not input secrets or client data. |
| Module 10: Continuous Improvement          | Keeping skills and tools up to date              | Continuously refine your AI workflows. Stay current on tools and prompting strategies. Solicit feedback and iterate on your practices for ongoing improvement. |
