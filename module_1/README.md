# Module 1: Modularizing Tasks for AI Coding

## Focus
Techniques for breaking down complex software tasks into smaller, modular prompts to get better results from AI coding assistants. This module covers prompt engineering strategies that improve controllability, accuracy, and debugging when using AI for coding. Senior engineers will learn to design multi-step workflows where AI handles well-defined subtasks rather than attempting to solve an entire problem at once.

---

## Task Decomposition Strategies
Best practices for splitting a large coding project or feature into discrete prompts or steps. Complex, multi-step requests can confuse AI models; instead, tasks should be segmented into manageable chunks. For example, rather than asking an AI to ‚Äúbuild a full financial report generation module,‚Äù first prompt it to outline the module‚Äôs components, then implement each component sequentially. This approach aligns with the ‚Äúfirst commandment‚Äù of effective prompting: break problems into smaller parts.

## Prompt Chaining and Iteration
How to use chain-of-thought prompting or iterative queries, where the output of one AI prompt becomes the input for the next. We will demonstrate chaining with a real scenario ‚Äì e.g., using ChatGPT to plan a feature, then refining each part step-by-step. This enhances the AI‚Äôs performance on each subtask, ensuring that nothing is overlooked along the way.

## Example Application: Modular AI Workflow for a Risk Scoring Feature

### Objective
Use ChatGPT to modularly develop a `riskScore(user)` function that:
- Fetches user profile data
- Computes a risk score based on age, credit history, and account activity
- Returns a structured JSON response

---

### Step-by-Step Prompts with Good and Bad Examples

---

### Step 1 ‚Äì **Plan the Workflow**

#### ‚úÖ Good Prompt
```
Break down a function that calculates a financial risk score into logical components.
The function should take a user ID and return a score.
List each component and what it does.
```

#### ‚ùå Bad Prompt
```
Write a risk scoring function.
```

---

### Step 2 ‚Äì **Fetch User Data (mock)**

#### ‚úÖ Good Prompt
```
Write a Python function called `fetch_user_data(user_id)` that returns a mock dictionary with this structure:
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "age": 35,
  "credit_score": 700,
  "missed_payments": 2,
  "login_frequency": 15,
  "transaction_volume": 5000
}
Use static data for now.
```

#### ‚ùå Bad Prompt
```
Make a function to get user info.
```

---

### Step 3 ‚Äì **Analyze Credit History**

#### ‚úÖ Good Prompt
```
Given the fields `credit_score` and `missed_payments`, write a function `analyze_credit_history(data)` that returns a float between 0.0 (low risk) and 1.0 (high risk).
Use a simple scoring formula.
```

#### ‚ùå Bad Prompt
```
Analyze credit risk.
```

---

### Step 4 ‚Äì **Analyze Account Activity**

#### ‚úÖ Good Prompt
```
Write a function `analyze_account_activity(data)` that uses `login_frequency` and `transaction_volume` to return a float between 0.0 (low risk) and 1.0 (high risk).
More logins and higher volume == less risk.
```

#### ‚ùå Bad Prompt
```
Tell me if the user is risky based on usage.
```

---

### Step 5 ‚Äì **Compute Final Score**

#### ‚úÖ Good Prompt
```
Create a function `compute_risk_score(credit_risk, behavior_risk)` that returns a weighted average risk score.
Use 60% weight for credit and 40% for behavior.
```

#### ‚ùå Bad Prompt
```
Combine the risks into a score.
```

---

### Step 6 ‚Äì **Final Assembly**

#### ‚úÖ Good Prompt
```
Write a function `riskScore(user_id)` that calls all the helper functions and returns this JSON structure:

{
  "user": "Jane Doe",
  "riskScore": 0.64,
  "details": {
    "creditRisk": 0.55,
    "behaviorRisk": 0.72
  }
}
Assume the helper functions already exist and return floats.
```

#### ‚ùå Bad Prompt
```
Write the whole thing that calculates the risk.
```

## üéØ Summary

This module demonstrates the value of **prompt chaining** and **task decomposition** in AI-assisted coding. Rather than asking for a complete solution in one go, we decompose the work, iterate on each step, and **preserve control** while speeding up development. You stay the architect ‚Äî AI handles the grunt work.

## ‚úÖ Do / ‚ùå Don‚Äôt

| Do                                                                 | Don‚Äôt                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Break complex work into small, modular subtasks and provide those pieces to the AI one at a time. | Don‚Äôt feed the AI a huge, monolithic problem. Overly broad requests confuse the model and produce unpredictable code. |
| Iteratively refine the AI‚Äôs output by building on previous results. | Don‚Äôt skip intermediate steps. If the AI‚Äôs first answer is off, refine the prompt and try again instead of giving up. |
| Clearly isolate parts of the code (e.g. separate frontend vs. backend). This helps the AI focus and not break unrelated code. | Don‚Äôt allow changes to ‚Äúsneak‚Äù into unrelated modules. Protect stable code boundaries so AI edits stay in the intended scope. |
